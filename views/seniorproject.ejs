        <p>This project focused on developing a platform that allows TAMUK students to communicate with each other for the purpose of purchasing and selling of university materials. 
        The platform was developed into a web application to facilitate its access. The most important goals of the project were to provide a safe and affordable environment for students. 
        Consequently, the web application only allows users to register with a TAMUK email account, and any other email address is restricted from registering into a new account. 
        Furthermore, no transactions occur through the web application to avoid imposing extra costs on the product. 
        Users can post their university materials with the price for sale, along with images of the product and details of the conditions found. 
        The only products that are allowed on the web application are university materials, e.g., books, calculators, microprocessors, lab materials, notebooks.</p>
